# Roblox-EzScript

NOTE: Please forgive my horrible code, this was a good while ago üòê

SETUP:

To setup EzScript, simply download the plugin (https://www.roblox.com/library/7117602638/EzScript)

Once the plugin is installed, go to Roblox Studio, on the top navigation bar, go to "Plugins" then click "Open Menu" on the script icon.

USING THE PLUGIN:

To use the plugin, simply select the location from your explorer of where you would like the script to be added to, example in the image below, I have the workspace selected
meaning the new script/local script will be created in the workspace:

Then, insert the Authors Name (your roblox username pretty much), followed by the reason for this script. Don't worry about the date as it is handled via the plugin.

Then, select what kind of script you want, a Local Script or a Script. 

Once all that is done, click "Create", a new script will be created with all the details you need

[IF YOU SEE A PROMPT ASKING FOR SCRIPT INJECTION, THAT IS YOUR SCRIPT BEING MADE, ALL THE PLUGIN CODE IS ABOVE]

DEVELOPER SUGGESTION:

Depending on how you have your studio laid out, if you'd like the plugin to look the best, I'd suggest having a similar setup to what I have currently:
